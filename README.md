A new 'sorting' algorithm derived from the popular meme sorting algorithm bogosort

# How it works
'Hope and pray' sort (or HPS for short) is a sorting algorithm based off of the quite unpopular sorting algorithm bogosort, an algorithm that sorts a list by randomizing it until it is sorted. HPS is similar in that it too randomizes a list of values, but instead it randomizes once and returns it in hopes that the list is sorted, hence 'hope and pray'.

This was an amazing joke that me and a friend came up with and is not meant to be used in any serious capacity, but you're welcome to if you're feeling lucky.
